I have worked on two projects.
# 1st)🚀 Fake News Detection using LSTM Neural Networks

## 🔍 Overview
Fake news is a growing problem in the digital age, and detecting misinformation is crucial for maintaining trust in media. This project focuses on building a fake news detection system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to classify news articles as real or fake with high accuracy.

## 📊 Dataset
The model is trained using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains labeled news articles, which are preprocessed before feeding into the LSTM network.

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing
To ensure high-quality input data, several preprocessing steps were applied:
- **Tokenization:** Converting text into sequences of tokens.
- **Removal of HTML tags:** Using BeautifulSoup to clean raw text.
- **Stopword Filtering:** Utilizing NLTK to remove common but unimportant words.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
The deep learning model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture consists of:
- **Embedding Layer:** Converts words into dense vector representations.
- **LSTM Layers:** Captures contextual dependencies in text sequences.
- **Dense Layers:** Performs final classification.

## 📈 Performance Evaluation
The model's effectiveness is assessed using:
- **Precision and Recall Metrics:** To measure accuracy and relevance.
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis:** To understand false positives and false negatives.

## 🎯 Outcome
This project significantly improved my skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sequence modeling. It demonstrates how LSTM networks can be leveraged to combat misinformation effectively through automated fake news detection.

## 📝 Conclusion
The project showcases the potential of deep learning in addressing real-world challenges like fake news. Future enhancements may include integrating transformers for even better text understanding and generalization.
