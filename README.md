I have worked on two projects.

📰 Fake News Detection using LSTM

🔍 Overview
A deep learning model using LSTM neural networks to classify news articles as real or fake, combating misinformation effectively.
📊 Dataset
Trained on a Kaggle dataset with labeled news articles, preprocessed for accuracy.
🛠️ Data Preprocessing
Tokenization: Converts text into sequences.
HTML Tag Removal: Cleaned using BeautifulSoup.
Stopword Filtering: Removed unimportant words with NLTK.
🏗️ Model Architecture
Embedding Layer: Converts words into vectors.
LSTM Layers: Captures text dependencies.
Dense Layers: Performs classification.
📈 Evaluation
Precision & Recall Metrics for accuracy.
Confusion Matrix Analysis to assess errors.
🎯 Outcome
Enhanced NLP & sequence modeling skills. Future improvements may include transformers for better text understanding.

🎨 Text-to-Image Generator with Stable Diffusion & Gradio

🔍 Overview
