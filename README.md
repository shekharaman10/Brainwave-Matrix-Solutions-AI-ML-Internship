## 📰 **Fake News Detection using LSTM**

### 🔍 **Overview**
- Built a deep learning model using **LSTM neural networks** to classify news articles as real or fake.
- Aims to combat misinformation effectively.

### 📊 **Dataset**
- Trained on a **Kaggle dataset** with labeled news articles.
- Preprocessed data to improve model accuracy.

### 🛠️ **Data Preprocessing**
- **Tokenization**: Converts text into sequences.
- **HTML Tag Removal**: Cleaned using **BeautifulSoup**.
- **Stopword Filtering**: Removed unimportant words with **NLTK**.

### 🏗️ **Model Architecture**
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors.
- **LSTM Layers**: Captures contextual dependencies.
- **Dense Layers**: Performs final classification.

### 📈 **Evaluation**
- **Precision & Recall Metrics** to measure accuracy.
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis** to assess errors.

### 🎯 **Outcome**
- Improved skills in **NLP & sequence modeling**.
- Future enhancements may include **transformers** for better text understanding.

# 🎨 Text-to-Image Generator using Stable Diffusion  

An AI-powered Text-to-Image Generator utilizing **Stable Diffusion** via Hugging Face API.  
This project provides an interactive interface using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, making it simple and easy to generate AI-generated images from text prompts.  

![Demo](loading.gif)

## 🔍 Overview  
- Uses **Stable Diffusion XL** from Hugging Face to generate images from text prompts.  
- Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for a sleek and minimal user experience.  
- Integrated with an API to fetch AI-generated images dynamically.  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
- **Stable Diffusion XL** via Hugging Face API  
- **JavaScript (Fetch API, DOM Manipulation)**  
- **HTML, CSS** (Modern UI with glowing neon effects)  
- **Gradio (in Text_to_image_gradio.ipynb )**
-  **Netlify.app** (for model deployment)

## 🎨 Features  
✅ **Text-to-Image Generation** using AI  
✅ **Interactive UI** with glowing neon aesthetics  
✅ **Loading Animation** to enhance user experience  
✅ **Error Handling** for API failures  
✅ **Optimized for Mobile & Desktop Browsing**  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Enter a text prompt in the input field.  
2. Click the **"Generate"** button.  
3. The script sends the prompt to Hugging Face's Stable Diffusion API.  
4. The generated image is displayed on the page.
