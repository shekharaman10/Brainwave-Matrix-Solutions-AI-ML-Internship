I have worked on two projects.
1)üöÄ Project: Fake News Detection using LSTM Neural Networks. "\n"
üîç Overview:
I developed a fake news detection system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify news articles as real or fake with high accuracy. Leveraging a Kaggle dataset, the project involved extensive data cleaning and preprocessing, including tokenization, removal of HTML tags, and stopword filtering using NLTK and BeautifulSoup.
The model architecture was built using TensorFlow and Keras, featuring an Embedding layer for word representation, followed by LSTM layers to capture contextual relationships, and Dense layers for final classification. Performance evaluation included precision, recall, and confusion matrix analysis, resulting in a highly accurate model.
üìà Outcome:
This project enhanced my skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sequence modeling, demonstrating the effectiveness of LSTMs in combating misinformation through automated fake news detection.
